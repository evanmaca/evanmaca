                        It contains a built-in navigation feature, allowing campus go-ers to search for specific buildings and even classrooms.

                    <br>
                    <p>Navigating university campus buildings can be confusing and difficult, especially for first time students who are 
                        transitioning from high school or even community college. I noticed that maps of campuses lack clear directions,
                         are oftentimes overwhelming to the eye to look at, and are even difficult to read.</p>

                        to get around campus and has the longevity to be used year round by a variety of users.</p>

                    <p>From my primary research I concluded 3 key insights which I used to guide my design process:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>94% of students had difficulties finding their classes within the first few months of stepping foot on campus</li>
                        <li>98% of students prefer to use a digital application for navigation rather than a traditional map</li>
                        <li>58%  of first generation students didn’t feel too confident in navigating their campus without help</li>
                      
                    </ul>   
                    <br>
                    <p>Some use cases that I derived for this application were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Being a new student and trying to find your classrooms for the first time</li>

                    <h3><b>Current Workarounds</b></h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Though applications such as Google maps provide great help for outdoor navigation (between building to building), there
                        is virtually no support for indoor navigation (within buildings). This presents an opportunity for me to step in and bridge this gap.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Floorplans</b></p>
                    <p>A current workaround that students have for finding their way around a building is to look at existing floor plans. 
                        Because applications such as Google Maps typically don’t support indoor navigation, students tend to look up floor plans online 
                        and map our their journey beforehand. </p>
                    <p>This workaround can be an issue because floor plans can be hard to find and aren’t typically published online. Even in the image 
                        example above, I struggled to find a floor plan of the Conley Art Building 2nd floor, I had to compromise and use an unofficial 
                        lighting fixture upgrade plan.</p>

                    <p><b>Asking Around</b></p>
                    <p>Another workaround that students have for indoor navigation is simply asking around. However, if the student is asking online, 
                        timing could be an issue if they’re just sitting there waiting for someone to respond. If the student is asking for help in person,
                         there is also a chance that the other person may not know where their destination is either.</p>

                    <p>Before ideating, I conducted a design audit of some of the key navigation apps campus go-ers tend to use. 
                        Google Maps contains good contrast of its elements which helps with accessibility. The app also has different 
                        language options which helps with user flexibility. It also has a live view AR option, where users can hold up their phone 
                        camera and an overlay will appear that guides them in the direction that they’re planning to go. </p>
                    <p>However, one of the downfalls of Google Maps is that it does not have accessible path options for wheelchair users. 
                       Meaning that users cannot customize their path to avoid staircases, heavy terrain, obstacles, etc.
                        In addition to this, there’s also no in-building navigation for campus buildings. </p>

                    <p>With Apple Maps, the information is clearly presented for the user. Using the app itself is very self explanatory.  
                        Like Google Maps, Apple Maps also contains written instructions in addition to a map view.</p>
                    <p>Something that Apple Maps also suffers from is the lack of accessible path options for wheelchair users, 
                        and there’s no in-building navigation for smaller places such as a campus building.</p>

                    <p>After looking at my options, I decided to go with a Native application.  
                        A native application uses the code libraries of whichever type of mobile device it’s operating on, and doing
                         this would let me use specific technologies from the phone such as GPS tracking, camera access, and push notifications. </p>
                    <p>Then I looked at some of the programming languages needed to build this app which includes Swift for IOS and Java for android. </p>

                    <p>After thinking about the technical requirements needed for my app, I then got started on producing low fidelity wireframes. 
                        This is the low fidelity wireframe of a flow that I conducted my usability test on.</p>
                    <p>The user flow is: Sign into the application > Browse for a location they would like to go > Choose between regular view or 
                        live view guidance > Exiting the application</p>

                    <p>I designed several homescreen options and determined which iteration drives the best outcomes. </p>
                    <p>Home screen version 1 relies too heavily on images compared to the other designs. Having just an image with a class number felt too vague. 
                        This version was also not informative enough; It lacks details such as distance and walk time. Such details give the user more 
                        information so they can make decisions quicker. </p>
                    <p>Home screen version 2 is the selected version. </p>
                    <p>Home screen version 3 was not selected because the shadow from the header breaks the sense of vertical motion when the eye looks at the app from top to bottom.  </p>
